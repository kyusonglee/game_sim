# Web Agent Training Guide

## Current Training Status âœ…
Your web agent is successfully training! Here's how to improve it:

## 1. Increase Training Episodes
```bash
# Train for more episodes to see learning progression
python agent.py --episodes 50

# For faster training without browser window
python agent.py --episodes 100 --headless
```

## 2. Monitor Training Progress
Check the generated files:
- `agent_training_results.json` - Episode statistics and success rates
- `debug_screenshot_*.png` - Visual snapshots of agent behavior
- Server logs - Detailed game state and action logs

## 3. Training Improvements Needed

### Current Limitations:
- Agent mostly explores randomly
- No learning from previous episodes
- Simple reward system
- No memory of successful strategies

### Recommended Enhancements:

#### A. Add Reinforcement Learning
```python
# Add Q-learning or policy gradient methods
# Save/load learned policies between episodes
# Implement experience replay
```

#### B. Improve Computer Vision
```python
# Better object detection algorithms
# Spatial relationship understanding
# Room recognition and mapping
```

#### C. Enhanced Decision Making
```python
# Goal-oriented planning
# Multi-step task decomposition
# Memory of successful action sequences
```

## 4. Training Data Collection

The web agent automatically collects:
- **Visual Data**: Screenshots for computer vision training
- **Action Sequences**: What actions work in different situations
- **Game State**: Robot position, objects, rooms, tasks
- **Success Metrics**: Task completion rates and scores

## 5. Advanced Training Approaches

### Imitation Learning
1. Record human gameplay sessions
2. Train agent to mimic successful human strategies
3. Use recorded data as training examples

### Curriculum Learning
1. Start with simple tasks (single room, one object)
2. Gradually increase complexity
3. Multi-room navigation and complex tasks

### Multi-Agent Training
1. Run multiple agents simultaneously
2. Share learned experiences between agents
3. Competitive or cooperative training

## 6. Performance Metrics

Track these metrics during training:
- **Success Rate**: % of tasks completed successfully
- **Efficiency**: Average actions per successful task
- **Exploration**: Coverage of game environment
- **Learning Speed**: Improvement rate over episodes

## 7. Quick Training Commands

```bash
# Basic training
python agent.py --episodes 10

# Extended training
python agent.py --episodes 50 --headless

# Test current performance
python test_web_agent.py

# Monitor web server
python run_agent.py play-web
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

If training stops:
1. Restart web server: `python run_agent.py play-web`
2. Check browser compatibility
3. Verify chromedriver installation: `pip install chromedriver-autoinstaller`

The agent is learning through trial and error - expect random behavior initially, with gradual improvement over many episodes!
